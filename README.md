netstat-based-network-map
=========================

#### Runs netstat (it actually access /proc/net/tcp and /proc/net/tcp6 directly) on client machines and send results to an aggregator server, which then builds a network-map based on the private-network connections. ####

*netstat_monitor.py* should be installed on machines to be monitored. This version is configured to collect TCP connections (IPv4 and IPv6) each 2 seconds, consolidate them, and send to the aggregator server each 10 seconds.  
For now data are being saved locally in a berkleydb key-value file for each client.  
**TODO:** timeouts, retries, failure detection, minimum connections

*netstat_aggregator.py* is the HTTP server that receives data from all clients and builds the network-map (currently also using berkleydb).  
**TODO:** this should be behind a VIP/load balancer, and use a distributed database

*netstat_ui.py* is a PoC HTTP server that displays the network-map build by the aggregator. A stronger line is used based on how many connections have been detected in the period.  
**TODO:** so much
